# Project Name

On week 1, we worked on creating a responsive pizzeria page; using only JavaScript "if else", "swicht", "alert", "prompt"

## The problem

We got a big support with the example on how the final product should looked; I personally had to reloaded several times to understand the logic behind it.
My main problem is/was to use the logic in general as well as when writting and setting up the variables.

I got a better idea when the "Music festival exercise" was showned. I also watched videos and google for better understanding.

If I had more time, I would have been add more "what if" cases and add more "what if the customer want to add and extra ingredient?" case.
